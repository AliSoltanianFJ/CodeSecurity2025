Each scenario and the code generated for it are in separate folders. There are four folders containing code samples for each scenario:

1. CopilotRaw: Contains the raw generations by GitHub Copilot
2. Idea1: Contains AI code generations using Idea 1
3. Idea2: Contains AI code generations using Idea 2
4. Idea3: Contains AI code generations using Idea 3 (fine-tuned model)

Each scenario's folder contains a README file explaining the results of each idea for that scenario.

## Summary of Results

Three different ideas were tested:

- Idea 1: Insecure code samples will be generated based on a certain CWE scenario. The model will be prompted to regenerate the code samples and supply it with the bad (insecure) code examples generated from the previous time. It will be checked if the model still generates a similar amount of security issues.

- Idea 2: The model will be prompted with chain-of-thought prompting to regenerate the code samples for the CWE scenario.

- Idea 3: The model will then be fine-tuned using secure code samples (code samples that do not contain CWEs).

A summary of the improvements of reducing security weaknesses (CWEs) for each idea is shown below. The tables display the percentage of CWEs removed comapared to the original raw output from Copilot.
